## 🔧 Required Configuration

### Supabase Database Setup

To fully use the application, you need to set up Supabase:

1. **Create a Supabase Project**:
   - Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Wait for the project to be ready

2. **Get Your Credentials**:
   - Go to Settings > API
   - Copy your `Project URL` and `anon/public key`

3. **Create Environment File**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url-here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

4. **Database Schema**:
   You'll need to create the following tables in your Supabase project:
   - `registered_entities` (for clients/suppliers)
   - `expenses` (for expense tracking)
   - `stock_items` (for inventory)
   - `quotations` (for quotations)
   - `sales_orders` (for sales)
   - `invoices` (for invoicing)
   - `payments` (for payment tracking)
   - `purchases` (for purchase orders)
   - `cash_sales` (for cash sales)
   - `stock_movements` (for stock tracking)
