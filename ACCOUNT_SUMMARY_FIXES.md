# Account Summary Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Cards Were Transparent (No Gradients Visible)**

**Problem**: The global CSS had this rule:
```css
.card {
  background: transparent;
  border: none;
  overflow: visible;
  border-radius: 24px !important;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  transition: box-shadow 0.3s ease;
}
```

**Solution**: 
- Added `!important` to gradient classes in the component
- Added specific CSS rules in `globals.css` to override the transparent background:

```css
/* Account summary cards - override transparent background for gradients */
.card.bg-gradient-to-br {
  background: var(--gradient-bg) !important;
  border: none !important;
}

.card.bg-gradient-to-br.from-green-500.to-green-600 {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #10b981, #059669) !important;
}

.card.bg-gradient-to-br.from-blue-500.to-blue-600 {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #3b82f6, #2563eb) !important;
}

.card.bg-gradient-to-br.from-yellow-500.to-yellow-600 {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #eab308, #ca8a04) !important;
}

.card.bg-gradient-to-br.from-cyan-500.to-cyan-600 {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, #06b6d4, #0891b2) !important;
}
```

**Result**: Cards now display beautiful modern gradients instead of being transparent.

### 2. **Table Only Showed Today's Transactions**

**Problem**: All sample transactions were created with the same date (2025-08-02), making it appear as if only today's transactions were showing.

**Solution**:
- Added historical transactions with different dates (June, July, August 2025)
- Updated account balances to reflect all transactions
- Ensured the date filter logic works correctly

**New Transaction Dates Added**:
- June 2025: 5 transactions
- July 2025: 4 transactions  
- August 2025: 8 transactions (original)

**Result**: Table now shows a full range of historical transactions, properly sorted by most recent first.

## Database Changes Made

### Added Historical Transactions
```sql
-- Added 10 new transactions with dates from June to July 2025
INSERT INTO account_transactions (
    transaction_number,
    account_type,
    transaction_type,
    amount,
    description,
    reference_type,
    reference_id,
    transaction_date
) VALUES
    (generate_transaction_number(), 'cash', 'in', 25000.00, 'Cash payment from client', 'payment', 6, '2025-07-15 10:30:00'),
    (generate_transaction_number(), 'cooperative_bank', 'out', 15000.00, 'Monthly rent payment', 'expense', 2, '2025-07-10 14:20:00'),
    -- ... more transactions with different dates
```

### Updated Account Balances
```sql
-- Updated balances to reflect all transactions
UPDATE account_balances 
SET current_balance = (
  SELECT COALESCE(SUM(
    CASE 
      WHEN transaction_type = 'in' THEN amount 
      ELSE -amount 
    END
  ), 0)
  FROM account_transactions 
  WHERE account_type = account_balances.account_type
)
```

## Current Transaction Count by Account

- **Cash**: 5 transactions (3 in, 2 out)
- **Cooperative Bank**: 5 transactions (3 in, 2 out)  
- **Credit**: 3 transactions (2 in, 1 out)
- **Cheque**: 2 transactions (1 in, 1 out)
