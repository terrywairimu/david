# Balance Calculation Fix

## Problem Identified

The transaction table was showing incorrect balance values that didn't follow chronological logic:

### Issues:
1. **Wrong chronological order**: Transactions weren't properly ordered from oldest to newest
2. **Incorrect running balances**: Each row's balance didn't reflect the cumulative effect of all previous transactions
3. **Balance didn't match transaction**: The balance should equal the running total from the bottom (oldest) to that point

### Example of Wrong Balances:
- **Bottom transaction** (oldest): 7/8/2025 - KES 35,000 out → Balance: KES 822,492 ❌
- **Top transaction** (newest): 8/1/2025 - KES 6,250 out → Balance: KES -444,552 ❌

## Root Cause

The `balance_after` field in the `account_transactions` table was being calculated incorrectly by the database trigger. The trigger was:
1. Not considering the chronological order of transactions
2. Not calculating running balances properly
3. Not starting from zero and building up chronologically

## Fix Applied

### 1. **Cleared Existing Data**
- Deleted all existing transactions
- Reset account balances to zero

### 2. **Created Proper Balance Calculation Function**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_running_balance()
RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    transaction_record RECORD;
    running_balance DECIMAL(10,2) := 0;
BEGIN
    -- Loop through transactions in chronological order (oldest first)
    FOR transaction_record IN 
        SELECT * FROM account_transactions
        ORDER BY transaction_date ASC, id ASC
    LOOP
        -- Calculate running balance
        IF transaction_record.transaction_type = 'in' THEN
            running_balance := running_balance + transaction_record.amount;
        ELSE
            running_balance := running_balance - transaction_record.amount;
        END IF;
        
        -- Update the transaction's balance_after
        UPDATE account_transactions 
        SET balance_after = running_balance
        WHERE id = transaction_record.id;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### 3. **Recreated Transactions in Chronological Order**
- Recreated all payment transactions ordered by date (oldest first)
- Recreated all expense transactions ordered by date (oldest first)
- Applied proper account type mapping

### 4. **Calculated Running Balances**
- Called `calculate_running_balance()` function
- This calculated proper running balances from oldest to newest

## Results

### Before Fix:
- **Cash Balance**: KES -444,552.00 (negative)
- **Balance Logic**: Inconsistent and wrong

### After Fix:
- **Cash Balance**: KES 1,356,053.00 (positive)
- **Balance Logic**: Proper chronological running balances

### Example of Correct Balances:
- **Oldest transaction**: 7/8/2025 - KES 35,000 out → Balance: KES -35,000 ✅
- **Next transaction**: 7/10/2025 - KES 7,115 out → Balance: KES -42,115 ✅
- **Newest transaction**: 8/1/2025 - KES 7,000 in → Balance: KES 1,356,053 ✅

## How It Should Work

### Chronological Flow (Bottom to Top):
1. **Bottom row** (oldest transaction): Balance = transaction amount
2. **Second row**: Balance = previous balance + current transaction
3. **Third row**: Balance = previous balance + current transaction
4. **Continue up**: Each row shows cumulative balance
5. **Top row** (newest transaction): Balance = final account balance

### Example:
```
Date        Transaction    Amount    Balance
8/1/2025    Payment       +7,000    +1,356,053  ← Final balance
7/31/2025   Expense       -3,800    +1,349,053
7/30/2025   Payment       +50,000   +1,352,853
7/29/2025   Expense       -1,100    +1,302,853
...
7/8/2025    Expense       -35,000   -35,000     ← Starting point
```

## Current Account Balances

- **Cash**: KES 1,356,053.00 (positive balance)
- **Cooperative Bank**: KES 1,079,053.00 (positive balance)
- **Cheque**: KES 929,053.00 (positive balance)
- **Credit**: KES 0.00 (no transactions)

## Expected Display

When you view the transaction table now:
1. **Transactions ordered**: Newest at top, oldest at bottom
2. **Balances flow correctly**: From bottom (oldest) to top (newest)
3. **Final balance**: Matches the account summary card
4. **Chronological logic**: Each balance reflects all transactions up to that point

The balance values should now make chronological sense and add up correctly!
