# Account Sync Fixes Completed

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Cooperative Bank Showing KES 0.00**
**Problem**: Cooperative Bank account was showing zero balance despite having payments assigned to it.

**Root Cause**: 
- Database functions were using wrong field names (`account_paid_to` instead of `account_credited`)
- Case conversion wasn't handling "Cooperative Bank" → "cooperative_bank" properly

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated database functions to use correct field names
- Fixed case conversion logic to handle "Cooperative Bank" → "cooperative_bank"
- Re-synced all existing payments and expenses

**Result**: 
- **Before**: KES 0.00
- **After**: KES 150,000.00 (1 transaction correctly assigned)

### 2. **Cash Showing Negative Balance**
**Problem**: Cash account was showing KES -574,028.96 (negative balance).

**Root Cause**: 
- Incorrect balance calculation logic
- Transactions not being assigned to correct account types

**Fix Applied**:
- Fixed database trigger function to properly calculate balances
- Re-synced all transactions with correct account type assignment

**Result**:
- **Before**: KES -574,028.96
- **After**: KES 646,053.00 (positive balance)

### 3. **Account Type Distribution**
**Problem**: All transactions were being assigned to 'cash' account type.

**Root Cause**: 
- Database functions weren't properly mapping account types
- Case conversion issues with capitalized values

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated database functions to properly map account types
- Fixed case conversion for "Cash", "Cooperative Bank", "Credit", "Cheque"

**Result**:
- **Cash**: 51 transactions (884,000 in, 237,947 out)
- **Cheque**: 1 transaction (560,000 in, 0 out)  
- **Cooperative Bank**: 1 transaction (150,000 in, 0 out)
- **Credit**: 0 transactions (no data yet)

## Database Changes Made

### 1. **Created Missing Tables**
- ✅ `account_transactions` table
- ✅ `account_balances` table
- ✅ `account_transactions_view` view

### 2. **Created Database Functions**
- ✅ `generate_transaction_number()` - Creates unique TXN numbers
- ✅ `update_account_balance()` - Automatically updates balances
- ✅ `create_account_transaction_from_payment()` - Creates transactions from payments
- ✅ `create_account_transaction_from_expense()` - Creates transactions from expenses
- ✅ `create_account_transaction_from_purchase()` - Creates transactions from purchases

### 3. **Created Database Triggers**
- ✅ `trigger_update_account_balance` - Updates balances when transactions are inserted
- ✅ `trigger_create_transaction_from_payment` - Creates transactions when payments are added
- ✅ `trigger_create_transaction_from_expense` - Creates transactions when expenses are added
- ✅ `trigger_create_transaction_from_purchase` - Creates transactions when purchases are added

### 4. **Fixed Field Name Mapping**
- ✅ Payments: `account_credited` field (not `account_paid_to`)
- ✅ Expenses: `account_debited` field (not `account_paid_from`)

### 5. **Fixed Case Conversion**
- ✅ "Cash" → "cash"
- ✅ "Cooperative Bank" → "cooperative_bank"
- ✅ "Credit" → "credit"
- ✅ "Cheque" → "cheque"

## Code Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed TypeScript Field References**
**File**: `app/payments/components/account-summary-view.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Reverted to use correct field names (`account_credited`, `account_debited`)
- Fixed case conversion logic to handle capitalized values
- Updated console logging to show correct field names

### 2. **Improved Account Type Mapping**
**Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD: Simple lowercase conversion
if (credited === 'cash' || credited === 'cooperative_bank' || ...)

// NEW: Proper case conversion
if (credited === 'cash') {
  accountType = 'cash'
} else if (credited === 'cooperative bank') {
  accountType = 'cooperative_bank'
} else if (credited === 'credit') {
  accountType = 'credit'
} else if (credited === 'cheque') {
  accountType = 'cheque'
}
```

## Current State

### Account Balances
- **Cash**: KES 646,053.00 (51 transactions)
- **Cooperative Bank**: KES 150,000.00 (1 transaction)
- **Cheque**: KES 560,000.00 (1 transaction)
- **Credit**: KES 0.00 (no transactions yet)

### Transaction Distribution
- **Total Transactions**: 53
- **Cash Transactions**: 51 (96.2%)
- **Cooperative Bank Transactions**: 1 (1.9%)
- **Cheque Transactions**: 1 (1.9%)
- **Credit Transactions**: 0 (0%)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application** to verify the account summary displays correctly
2. **Create new payments/expenses** to test automatic transaction creation
3. **Monitor balance calculations** to ensure they remain accurate
4. **Add more transactions** to other account types as needed

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- ✅ **Cooperative Bank** should show KES 150,000.00
- ✅ **Cash** should show positive balance (KES 646,053.00)
- ✅ **All accounts** should show proper money in/out values
- ✅ **Sync** should work correctly with proper account type mapping
- ✅ **New transactions** should be automatically created with correct account types
