# Real-Time Account Summary Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Payment Data Mismatch**
**Problem**: The account summary was showing incorrect data for payment PN2507003:
- **Payment Management**: KES 100,000.00, Cash account, 7/14/2025
- **Account Summary**: KES 75,000.00, Credit account, 8/2/2025

**Root Cause**: The transaction creation logic was not using real payment data correctly.

### 2. **Incorrect Account Type Mapping**
**Problem**: Payment method was being mapped incorrectly to account type.
- Payment had `payment_method = 'cash'` and `account_credited = 'Cash'`
- But transaction showed `account_type = 'credit'`

**Fix**: Updated logic to prioritize `account_credited` field over `payment_method`.

### 3. **Missing Real-Time Updates**
**Problem**: Account summary wasn't updating automatically when new payments were created.

**Fix**: Added real-time Supabase subscriptions for automatic updates.

### 4. **Generic Transaction Descriptions**
**Problem**: Account summary was showing generic descriptions like "Payment received - EN2507029" instead of real descriptions from source documents.

**Fix**: Updated all transaction creation logic to use real descriptions from source documents:
- **Payments**: Use `payment.description` or fallback to `payment.payment_number`
- **Expenses**: Use `expense.description` or fallback to `expense.expense_number`
- **Purchases**: Use `purchase.notes` or fallback to `purchase.purchase_order_number`

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Corrected Transaction Creation Logic**

**File**: `app/payments/components/account-summary-view.tsx`

**Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD: Only used payment_method
if (payment.payment_method) {
  const method = payment.payment_method.toLowerCase()
  if (method === 'cash' || method === 'cooperative_bank' || method === 'credit' || method === 'cheque') {
    accountType = method
  }
}

// NEW: Prioritize account_credited, fallback to payment_method
if (payment.account_credited) {
  const credited = payment.account_credited.toLowerCase()
  if (credited === 'cash' || credited === 'cooperative_bank' || credited === 'credit' || credited === 'cheque') {
    accountType = credited
  }
} else if (payment.payment_method) {
  const method = payment.payment_method.toLowerCase()
  if (method === 'cash' || method === 'cooperative_bank' || method === 'credit' || method === 'cheque') {
    accountType = method
  }
}
```

### 2. **Updated Transaction Descriptions to Use Real Data**

**Files Updated**:
- `app/payments/components/account-summary-view.tsx`
- `lib/workflow-utils.ts`
- `scripts/create-account-tables.sql`

**Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD: Generic descriptions
description: payment.description || `Payment received - ${payment.payment_number}`
description: expense.description || `Expense - ${expense.expense_number}`

// NEW: Real descriptions from source documents
description: payment.description || payment.payment_number
description: expense.description || expense.expense_number
```

**Database Triggers Updated**:
```sql
-- OLD: Generic descriptions
COALESCE(NEW.description, 'Payment received - ' || NEW.payment_number)
COALESCE(NEW.description, 'Expense - ' || NEW.expense_number)

-- NEW: Real descriptions
COALESCE(NEW.description, NEW.payment_number)
COALESCE(NEW.description, NEW.expense_number)
```

### 3. **Added Transaction Update Logic**

**New Feature**: System now updates existing transactions when payment data changes.

**Example**: 
- **Before**: "Payment received - EN2507029"
- **After**: "IRISH VILLAGE FUNDI LUNCH @ 3030" (actual description from payment record)

### 4. **Added Real-Time Updates**

**New Feature**: Account summary now updates automatically when new payments are created.

**Implementation**: Added Supabase real-time subscriptions for automatic updates.

## Result

The account summary now displays:
- **Real descriptions** from source documents (e.g., "IRISH VILLAGE FUNDI LUNCH @ 3030")
- **Correct account types** based on `account_credited` field
- **Accurate amounts** matching the original payment data
- **Automatic updates** when new transactions are created
