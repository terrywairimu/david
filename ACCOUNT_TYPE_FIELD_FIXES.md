# Account Type Field Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Field Name Mismatch**
**Problem**: The sync logic was trying to access fields that don't exist in the database:
- Code was looking for `account_credited` but database has `account_paid_to`
- Code was looking for `account_debited` but database has `account_paid_from`

**Root Cause**: The field names in the code don't match the actual database schema.

### 2. **Missing Database Tables**
**Problem**: The `account_transactions` and `account_balances` tables mentioned in documentation don't exist in the current database schema.

**Impact**: 
- No transaction tracking
- No balance calculations
- All transactions defaulting to 'cash' account type

### 3. **Incorrect Balance Calculations**
**Problem**: Cash account showing negative balance (KES -574028.96) which suggests incorrect balance calculation logic.

## Database Schema Analysis

### Current Tables (from create-tables-v1.sql)
- **payments**: Has `account_paid_to` field
- **expenses**: Has `account_paid_from` field  
- **purchases**: Has `payment_method` field

### Missing Tables
- **account_transactions**: Should track all financial transactions
- **account_balances**: Should track current balances per account type
- **account_transactions_view**: Should provide calculated view with money_in/money_out

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Field Name References**
**File**: `app/payments/components/account-summary-view.tsx`

**Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD: Using non-existent fields
if (payment.account_credited) { ... }
if (expense.account_debited) { ... }

// NEW: Using correct database fields
if (payment.account_paid_to) { ... }
if (expense.account_paid_from) { ... }
```

### 2. **Updated Console Logging**
**Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD
account_credited: payment.account_credited,
account_debited: expense.account_debited,

// NEW
account_paid_to: payment.account_paid_to,
account_paid_from: expense.account_paid_from,
```

## Remaining Issues

### 1. **Missing Database Tables**
The `account_transactions` and `account_balances` tables need to be created with proper schema.

### 2. **Missing Database Functions**
The following functions need to be created:
- `update_account_balance()`
- `generate_transaction_number()`
- `create_account_transaction_from_payment()`
- `create_account_transaction_from_expense()`
- `create_account_transaction_from_purchase()`

### 3. **Missing Database Triggers**
The following triggers need to be created:
- `trigger_update_account_balance`
- `trigger_create_transaction_from_payment`
- `trigger_create_transaction_from_expense`
- `trigger_create_transaction_from_purchase`

### 4. **Missing Database View**
The `account_transactions_view` needs to be created with proper money_in/money_out calculations.

## Next Steps

1. **Create missing database tables, functions, and triggers**
2. **Test the field name fixes**
3. **Verify account type mapping works correctly**
4. **Test balance calculations**
5. **Verify sync functionality**

## Expected Results

After fixes:
- **Cooperative Bank**: Should show transactions when `account_paid_to` or `account_paid_from` is set to 'cooperative_bank'
- **Cash**: Should show correct positive balance
- **All accounts**: Should show proper money in/out values
- **Sync**: Should work correctly with proper account type mapping
